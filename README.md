# Full-Stack Blog Application developed with Node.js and Express MVC

## üìù Project Overview

This repository contains a complete web application implemented as a **Full-Stack Blog**. The application adheres to the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern, utilizing Express.js, and exposes a comprehensive **RESTful API** for resource management.

The application's core features, developed iteratively across multiple phases, include:

1.  **Core Website Functionality:** Home page and an Author/CV page.
2.  **Post Management (CRUD):** Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities for blog posts, including managing image attachments.
3.  **User Management:** A complete API for user registration and management.
4.  **Authentication:** A session-based **Login/Logout** system to secure and restrict access to privileged blog functionalities.

    npm run migrate
    npm run seed
    ```
    *For Windows systems:*
    ```bash
    npm run migrate_win
    npm run seed_win
    ```

3.  **Start the Server:**
